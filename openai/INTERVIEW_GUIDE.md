# OpenAI Interview Guide

**Process, patterns, and how to prepare effectively**

OpenAI's interviews are not just "grind LeetCode and hope for the best." They tend to be:

- **Open-ended** – framed around realistic problems rather than toy puzzles
- **Follow-up heavy** – the real evaluation happens in the follow-up questions
- **Depth-focused** – if you claim expertise in something, they go deep

This guide summarizes the OpenAI interview process, what interviewers look for, and how to prepare in a focused way. Whether you're targeting a software engineering role or an ML-focused position, understanding OpenAI's unique interview style is crucial for success.

**Looking for real OpenAI interview questions?** We've curated an up-to-date collection of verified questions at [darkinterview.com](https://darkinterview.com/companies/openai), sourced from recent candidates and updated regularly. Practice with the same questions you'll actually see in your interviews.

## 1. OpenAI Interview Process Overview

The exact loop varies by team and role, but a typical OpenAI software/ML engineer process looks like:

### 1. Recruiter Screen
- Background, experience, what you're looking for
- Overview of the role and team
- High-level alignment check

### 2. Tech Screen (2 rounds)
- **One Coding round**
- **One System Design round**

For more ML-heavy roles, these may become:
- ML Coding instead of standard coding
- ML Design instead of generic system design

### 3. Virtual Onsite (3–4 rounds)
Usually includes:
- **System Design** (or ML Design)
- **Coding** (or ML Coding)
- **Project Deep Dive**
  - You present one or two past projects using slides
  - Interviewers probe architecture, tradeoffs, failures, metrics
- **Behavioral / Culture fit**
  - Example topics: Discussion about your views on AGI and AI Safety
  - Standard conflict / leadership / ownership questions
  - Generally straightforward; not designed as a "gotcha" round, but shallow answers still hurt

### 4. Hiring Manager (some candidates)
- Not everyone gets this round
- Focus on team fit, expectations, roadmap, and how you'd be positioned in the team
- May include light technical or scenario questions

That's the backbone of the OpenAI interview process you should plan around.

## 2. Round-by-Round Breakdown

### 2.1 Recruiter Screen

**What to expect:**
- Walkthrough of your recent experience
- Why you're interested in OpenAI and this role
- What kind of work/teams you're targeting (infra, product, safety, applied, research, etc.)

**How to prepare:**
- Be able to summarize your last 1–2 roles in 2–3 sentences each
- Have a clear, specific answer to "Why OpenAI?" and "Why this role/team?"

---

### 2.2 Tech Screen (Coding + System Design / ML Design)

#### Coding (or ML Coding)

**What to expect:**
- Clarifying the problem
- Choosing reasonable approaches
- Writing correct, clean code
- High bar for correctness – they expect strong solutions given the competitive candidate pool
- Follow-up questions after solving the basic problem
- Handling edge cases and test cases proactively

#### System Design (or ML Design)

**Interviewers look for:**
- Clear problem decomposition
- Reasonable architecture and tradeoffs
- How your design evolves under new constraints (scale, latency, cost, reliability)

---

### 2.3 Virtual Onsite

#### System Design / ML Design
- Deeper and more open-ended than the screen
- Expect multiple rounds of follow-up:
  - "What if traffic grows 100x?"
  - "What if we prioritize latency over cost?"
  - "What breaks first, and how do you know?"

**Aim to show:**
- Structured thinking
- Awareness of tradeoffs
- Ability to iterate on your own design calmly

#### Coding / ML Coding
- Similar flavor to the screen, but may be more complex or have additional constraints

#### Project Deep Dive (with slides)
This is a key round.

**What to expect:**
- You prepare a slide deck about a significant project
- You present:
  - Problem context and goals
  - Constraints and success metrics
  - Architecture and key decisions
  - Performance/reliability considerations
  - Failures, incidents, and what you learned
- Interviewers then deep dive:
  - "Why this design?"
  - "What were the main tradeoffs?"
  - "What went wrong in production?"
  - "How did you measure success?"

**How to prepare:**
- Pick a project that shows meaningful ownership
- Practice presenting and handling potential questions from the interviewer

#### Behavioral / Culture
**What to expect:**
- Discussion of:
  - Your views on AI (e.g., benefits, risks, timelines, responsible deployment)
  - Your thoughts on AI Safety (what matters, what tradeoffs you see)
- Standard behavioral questions about:
  - Conflict with teammates
  - Leading projects or initiatives
  - Handling failure, feedback, and uncertainty

This round is usually not "trick-heavy" but shallow or inconsistent answers can hurt you.

**How to prepare:**
- Prepare 4–6 concrete stories:
  - A difficult project
  - A conflict and how you resolved it
  - A failure/incident and what you learned
  - A time you took ownership and drove something forward
- Think through:
  - What you hope AI will be used for
  - Risks or failure modes you care about
  - How to balance innovation and safety in your work

---

### 2.4 Hiring Manager

Not everyone gets this round, but when it happens:

**Expect discussions about:**
- The team's current and upcoming projects
- Your role, scope, and growth path
- How you like to work and what you're optimizing for
- There may be light technical or scenario questions, but the focus is fit and expectations

**How to prepare:**
- Be honest about what kind of work and environment you want
- Prepare thoughtful questions about the team, roadmap, and collaboration style

---

## 3. Role Variations: SWE vs ML-Focused Roles

The core structure is similar, but for more ML-focused roles:

**Coding → ML Coding**
- More data/ML-flavored problems
- Some emphasis on numerical stability, metrics, evaluation logic, etc.

**System Design → ML Design**
- ML training and serving pipelines
- Feature/data flow, labeling, feedback loops
- Evaluation frameworks and experimentation

Regardless of the flavor, OpenAI expects solid engineering fundamentals and the ability to reason about systems, not just models in isolation.

## 4. How to Prepare Efficiently

### The Traditional Approach Doesn't Work

Many candidates spend months grinding random LeetCode problems or watching generic system design videos, only to be caught off-guard by OpenAI's specific interview style and questions. The problem? **OpenAI draws from a relatively small, rotating set of questions** – and those questions are quite different from typical FAANG interviews.

### A More Strategic Approach

Instead of studying 1,000+ random problems, focus on:

✅ **Real OpenAI questions** – Practice with verified questions from recent interviews  
✅ **Depth over breadth** – Master the patterns and follow-up variations  
✅ **Complete preparation** – Combine technical prep with project stories and AI safety perspectives  

### Why Our Question Bank Works

At [darkinterview.com](https://darkinterview.com/companies/openai), we've built a comprehensive, continuously-updated collection of **real OpenAI interview questions**:

- **Verified questions** across coding, system design and ML design rounds
- **Sourced from recent candidates** – questions reported in the last 6 months
- **Regular updates** – we track multiple data sources and add new questions as they appear
- **Company-specific patterns** – understand what makes OpenAI interviews unique
- **Interactive practice environment** – code editor for coding questions, canvas for system design

### The Difference It Makes

Instead of wondering "Will I see something like this?", you'll know "I've practiced this exact type of question." When you walk into your OpenAI interview, you'll recognize the patterns, anticipate the follow-ups, and demonstrate the depth they're looking for.

**Combined with solid fundamentals and well-prepared project stories, you'll be in the strongest possible position for your OpenAI interviews.**
